[34m[39mShannen Doherty

[34mShannen Says[39m is an eight-episode American [34mreality television[39m series broadcast on [34mWE TV[39m in 2012. The show focuses on the preparations for the wedding of actress [34mShannen Doherty[39m (pictured) and photographer Kurt Iswarienko, with help from celebrity-wedding planner [34mDavid Tutera[39m. Filmed in [34mMalibu, California[39m, in 2011, Shannen Says was developed by Doherty and Iswarienko as a way to document the stress a couple experiences while planning their wedding. It was produced by [34mRelativityReal[39m and Doherty's production company No Apologies Productions. To prepare for filming, Doherty watched reality shows by [34mTori Spelling[39m and [34mKim Kardashian[39m. The series was released on the [34miTunes Store[39m and [34mAmazon Video[39m, but it was not made available on DVD or Blu-ray. The show had low viewership and ranked below most other programs when it premiered, but it had some popularity among women between the ages of 25 and 54. Shannen Says and Doherty received mixed reviews. ([34mFull¬†article...[39m)

[34m[39mMajor-General [34mCharles Keightley[39m (on right), the commanding officer of the [34m78th Infantry Division[39m

On 3¬†September 1939, at the start of the Second World War, the [34mUnited Kingdom had 2 armoured, 24 infantry, and 7 anti-aircraft divisions[39m. A [34mdivision[39m was a self-contained formation that possessed all the required forces for combat, which was supplemented by its own [34martillery[39m, [34mengineers[39m, communications and [34msupply[39m units. In September, the [34mBritish Army[39m stated that 55 divisions (a mix of [34marmoured[39m, [34minfantry[39m and [34mcavalry[39m) would be raised to combat [34mGermany[39m. The UK would provide 32 of these formations and the remainder would be raised by the [34mDominions[39m and [34mIndia[39m. In 1941, this goal was adjusted to 57 divisions, with the UK to provide 36. By the end of 1941, the UK had met its quota. During the war, 85 divisional formations were raised but did not all exist simultaneously and not all of them were combat formations. The 85 divisional formations included 2 [34mairborne[39m, 12 [34manti-aircraft[39m, 11 armoured, 1 cavalry, 10 coastal defence (known as [34mCounty Divisions[39m) and 49 infantry divisions. At the end of the war, in 1945, the British Army had 24 divisions. ([34mFull¬†list...[39m)

[34m[39m



The [34mpainted buttonquail[39m (Turnix varius) is a species of [34mbuttonquail[39m, the family Turnicidae, which resemble, but are unrelated to, the [34mquails[39m of [34mPhasianidae[39m. The painted buttonquail is native to Australia. Its range extends from Queensland southwards to New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania. A separate population is present in the southwestern part of Western Australia. The subspecies T.¬†v.¬†scintillans is endemic to the [34mHoutman Abrolhos[39m, a chain of islands off the west coast of Australia. This painted buttonquail was photographed in the [34mCastlereagh Nature Reserve[39m near Sydney, New South Wales.
